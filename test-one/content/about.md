I'm a generalist software developer who loves programming / design & analysis of algorithms. I've worked in many projects mostly around writing services and I'm currently working in Microsoft IDC, Bengaluru. I'm generally interested in sports, programming and wasting time thinking about random stuff but what I end up doing mostly is procrastination(**you'll see soon**) for some reason :)

I started and stopped a blog in college - couldn't manage it (**you see it now**). In the meantime as a professional I think I've learned lots of stuff, forgotten few and other got stuck because of inherent beauty of software as it is. I'm a true believer of [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and how it's shaping the future of the Software and the World! This blog is another attempt to maintaining a journal (mostly tech) which could help me reflecting upon the time I spend in industry.

You can find my contact in the left pane, shoot an email to **(concat "kandpaleatesh" "@" "gmail" "." "com")**.
