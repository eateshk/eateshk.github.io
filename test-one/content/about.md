I'm a generalist software developer who loves programming / design & analysis of algorithms. My work has mostly been around writing services. I'm currently working for Microsoft IDC, Bengaluru. I'm generally interested in sports, programming and wasting time thinking about random stuff but what I end up doing mostly is procrastination(**you'll see soon**) for some reason :)

I both started and stopped blogging in college - couldn't maintain it (**you see it now**). In the meantime as a professional I think I've learned lots of stuff, forgotten some and some of it got stuck forever because of inherent beauty of software as it is. I'm a true believer of [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and how it's shaping the future of the Software and the World! This blog is another attempt to maintaining a journal (mostly tech) which could help me reflecting upon the time I spend in industry.
